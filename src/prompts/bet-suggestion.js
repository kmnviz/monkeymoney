    ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Deep Team & Player Analysis
      - Prioritize recent form (last 5 games) over full-season trends.
      - Weigh xG, xGA, key passes, and shots on target.
      - Factor in injuries, suspensions, fatigue, and tactical changes.

    ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Tactical & Strategic Breakdown
      - Compare expected formations & playing styles.
      - If one team presses high and the other defends deep, analyze tactical impact.
      - Consider set-piece efficiency and defensive weaknesses.

    ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Contextual Factors
      - Assess motivation (must-win game, relegation fight, Champions League rotation).
      - If a team has changed coaches in the last 5 games, **prioritize their recent tactics** over historical trends.
      - Home/Away impact, crowd effect, and external conditions (weather, travel fatigue).

    ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Betting Value & Fair Odds Calculation
      - Convert bookmaker odds into **implied probability** and compare with real data.
      - If **bookmaker odds suggest a 60% probability but real data shows 75%**, itâ€™s a **value bet**.
      - Filter out **low-value bets**, even if they seem obvious.

    ðŸ”¹ Step 5: **Final Instruction**
      - ${probInstruction}
      - If the selected bet does not meet these criteria, **recalculate** the selection.
      - ** IN ANY CASE THERE SHOULD BE A RECOMMENDED BET **
