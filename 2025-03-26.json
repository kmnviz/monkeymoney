      "comprehensive_detailed_reason": "1️⃣ **Recent Form & Tactical Context**: Both teams scored 2 goals each in their last H2H (2-2 draw), with 4 total goals. Puerto Rico's red-card suspension (defender Giovanni Calderon) weakens their defense, likely forcing a deeper defensive line and increasing Dominican Republic's attacking opportunities. Both teams average 2 goals scored/conceded in their last match, showing defensive vulnerabilities. 2️⃣ **H2H Trends**: 3/4 historical H2H matches had Over 2.5 goals, including a 4-goal thriller in March 2025. 3️⃣ **Strategic Impact**: Dominican Republic's height advantage (182.69cm avg vs 176.8cm) amplifies set-piece threat, while Puerto Rico’s fatigue from defending with 10 men could lead to late-game breakdowns. 4️⃣ **Value Calculation**: Odds of 1.781 imply a 56% probability, but historical data and tactical shifts suggest a 70%+ likelihood of 3+ goals. This discrepancy creates strong betting value."

Recent H2H trends show 5/10 matches ended with BTTS = NO. Plaza's xGA (0.57/game) and Boston's low away scoring (1.25 goals/game) further support this bet. Though slightly below the 70% threshold, this offers the strongest value given Boston's attacking inefficiency and Plaza's home defensive record (2 clean sheets in 3 home games)."

(2) Tactical mismatch: Ferroviária's high press (scored 4 second-half goals) exploits Grêmio's low block (conceded 4 goals in 75-90 mins). (3) Context: Ferroviária leads the league, uses U20 Brazil talents, while Grêmio sits 12th with no clean sheets. (4) H2H: Ferroviária won last 2 meetings. Real probability (75%) vastly exceeds bookmaker's implied 56% (1.78 odds), creating exceptional value."
